This is the [Custom Workspace Image](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image) for Temporal's [self-paced online courses](https://learn.temporal.io/courses/).

It installs each of the languages — Java, Go, Python, and Nodejs — currently used in our courses, as well as the `temporal` and `tctl` command-line clients.
